ZeroIndexed is my personal blog, it has no business collecting your private information or forwarding it to third parties.

For personal vanity (and hand waving claims of tailoring content to readership), the site counts page views by loading resources from <https://toph.zeroindexed.com>, which ultimately sends anonymized data to Google Analytics. To be clear, this form of analytics does not use cookies and even things like IP address and `User-Agent` are not leaked to third parties.

This site is hosted by GitHub pages, see their [privacy policy][github-pages-privacy] for what information they collect.

<https://toph.zeroindexed.com> is hosted by [Cloudflare workers][cloudflare-workers], see the [Cloudflare privacy policy][cloudflare-privacy].
