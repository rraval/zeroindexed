title: Universal constraints and startup katas
---

This blog post is a distillation of various pieces of advice I've encountered in the startup sphere. This is a personal rationalization of my experiences [living in an entrepreneurially minded student dorm][velocity-residence], later [coaching student teams on the side][velocity-coach], co-founding [a business-to-business software-as-a-service company][encircle], and generally having spent almost a decade reading lots of blog posts and getting into arguments about how to run a company.

I don't mean for my "credentials" to add any authoritative weight to my points, the goal here is to highlight the gaps in my experiences: business-to-consumer ventures are completely different, my experiences are in software, etc. In particular, I'm framing these concepts as "universal", so [tell me what I've missed][email].

# What are startup katas?

I'm borrowing a term from martial arts here: a kata is a choreographed sequence of moves that can be taught in isolation and practiced over and over again.

For startups, there is a lot of pre-packaged advice floating around, things you should or should not do because they have worked for so-and-so company. I call this kind of advice a "startup kata" because it's essentially teaching a choreographed move.

Let's say you're reading [Hacker News][hn] and you come across a blog post that says "don't innovate on management structure". That's a kata, a pre-packaged bundle of advice that may or may not apply to your specific situation. It seems self evident that you shouldn't blindly apply advice, but breaking down and rationalizing things can be difficult.

"Universal constraints" are my attempt to identify the broader principles that these katas are appealing to. They form a framework to reason about and evaluate your specific situation as it relates to the kata, allowing critical thinking that backs implementing the advice or swimming against conventional wisdom.

# Energy budgets

Let's make 2 axiomatic statements:

1. Actions take energy.
2. Entities, whether people or organizations, have a fixed overall pool of energy.

If these premises are accepted, then the implications apply to any company you start (and all companies in general, but we'll get to that). Let's see how this lens lets us unpack actual katas:

> Clarity and simplicity are important–I wouldn't try to innovate on management structure.

Your startup has a fixed energy budget. As a founder, you have a disproportionate say in where that energy is spent, but you must pick your battles wisely.

Straying from the norm requires some initial energy expenditure to decide what management structure to implement, and then periodic energy expenditure to course correct for the changing state of the world. Implementing a status quo management structure takes less energy than innovating.

The overwhelming majority of startups struggle on the traditionally hard parts of extracting value as a company, things like "product market fit" and "business models". On the margin, energy spent innovating on management structure is likely better spent solving those other problems instead.
